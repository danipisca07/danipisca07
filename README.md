# Danipisca's messy code and snippets closet

I'm a computer engineer that is particularly in love with stuff that is distributed. In my repos you will find all my test and attempts to create something cool. 
Usually I don't have secrets to hide so I always public the repository here in case it can be useful to someone.
If you fell like contributing or asking a question please do so!
